We a team of 4 developed a novel Cryptographic method wherein we leveraged
the [Traditional Playfair cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher) algorithm by
constructing a key square of size 4\*19 in contrast to standard
size of 5\*5 and use the [RSA algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))  along with the
proposed novel technique - RMPS keyless transposition to
further enhance the security and confidentiality of the
message.
